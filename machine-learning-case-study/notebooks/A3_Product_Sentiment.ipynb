       "'I have never written a review for Amazon but I saw some of the poor reviews on the Diaper Champ and had to add my two cents   When my sister got pregnant she could not decide if she should register for the Diaper Champ or the Diaper Genie  She left it up to me and after reviewing both items I went with the Diaper Champ     The idea of having to continually purchase bags for the Diaper Genie seemed like a waste when the Diaper Champ lets you use any type of bag     My nephew is now over two years old and while he has begun potty training my sister still uses the Diaper Champ I gave her   When it came time for me to choose a diaper disposal system I put the Diaper Champ on my registry  Yes it can be a bit tricky to open I found using two hands works best but then again do I want something that is holding wet and otherwise dirty diapers to open easily  True the mechanism sometimes wont swing the dirty diaper into the pail but HELLO that is a sign that it is probably time to put in a new bag  Yes it can eventually start to smell if you dont change it regularly    but then again if you used a metal safe lined with carbon to hold your kids diapers eventually baby poop and pee smell would emanate from it if you didnt clean it out regularly    Realistically the thing holds dirty stinky diapers and yep it is going to smell when you open it but hey    my kids tush smells when I wipe it but I still love him My personal tip    if you belong to a wholesale club like BJs Costco or Sams check to see if they have the Glad Kitchen Bags  The BJs we shop in has a box of 200 for 999  As long as you do not attempt to overstuff them ie get lazy and dont change the bag regularly they work perfectly  I also use them in the small garbage pails in our apartment  I could wait for a sale and use a coupon the way I shop for most things but it takes months to go through the box and I like knowing they are always on hand    At about 05 a bag the super duper box of bags makes my life easy and that as any parent knows is PRICELESS'"
